## Project Overview

This project presents a **Power BI** dashboard created using Blinkit sales data. Blinkit, India's Last-Minute App, provides rapid delivery services. This dashboard provides insights into total sales, average sales, item types, outlet types, and locations, all aggregated to help in decision-making processes.

2. **Average Sales**: $141
3. **Number of Items**: 8523
4. **Average Rating**: 3.9/5

## Visualizations

The dashboard is divided into several sections for better comprehension:

2. **Item Types & Sales**: A bar chart highlighting sales of different categories like fruits, snack food, household items, and more.
3. **Fat Content & Sales by Outlet**: Sales breakdown based on fat content (low fat and regular) and outlet type.
4. **Outlet Size & Location**: Distribution of sales by outlet size (medium, small, high) and location tiers (Tier 1, 2, 3 cities).
5. **Outlet Type**: A comparison of grocery stores and supermarkets in terms of total sales, number of items, average sales, and ratings.

These filters enable users to view specific details based on their preferences or needs.
